<summary> Simplicity </summary>

- Prefer simple instructions over complicated ones, even if that means using more lines or duplicating code.

- Avoid one-liners, complicated conditions, language specificities and abstract/generic patterns.

- If your code needs to be explained, comment it.. or even better, rewrite it in a simpler way.
